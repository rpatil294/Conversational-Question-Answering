Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD . During the Migration Period , the Germanic tribes expanded southward . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 . The German revolutions of 1848\u201349 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights .    In 1871 , Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian - dominated German Empire . After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918\u201319 , the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic . In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and the Holocaust .

The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub - division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one .    Historically , the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid , as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history . The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy .

Seven years later , \" Night Film \" is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype . Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment , the studio behind \" Oblivion \" and \" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , \" and critics are raving about Pessl 's multimedia storytelling approach , which takes readers beyond the novel 's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed - up reporter out to expose him .

His movies are so frightening no theater will show them ; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings .    Investigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired , costing him his job , marriage and reputation . When Cordova 's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide , McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall .    Pessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles , newspaper headlines , police reports , crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards . She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues"}, {"id": "3wrfbplxraow7at6ide020z2w3tn33", "turn_id": 2, "answer": "Pessl burst onto the scene in 2006 with \" Special Topics in Calamity Physics"}, {"id": "3wrfbplxraow7at6ide020z2w3tn33", "turn_id": 6, "answer": "greater expectations"}, {"id": "3wrfbplxraow7at6ide020z2w3tn33", "turn_id": 8, "answer": "six - figure advance"}, {"id": "3wrfbplxraow7at6ide020z2w3tn33", "turn_id": 9, "answer": "Seven years later , \" Night Film \" is hitting bookstores this week"}, {"id": "3wrfbplxraow7at6ide020z2w3tn33", "turn_id": 10, "answer": "Pessl burst onto the scene in 2006 with \" Special Topics in Calamity Physics ."}, {"id": "374tnbha8bviqa3mnqz7woqk90aqy3", "turn_id": 1, "answer": "Albert Pujols"}, {"id": "374tnbha8bviqa3mnqz7woqk90aqy3", "turn_id": 2, "answer": "Pablo Sandoval 's record - tying three home runs led the San Francisco Giants"}, {"id": "374tnbha8bviqa3mnqz7woqk90aqy3", "turn_id": 3, "answer": "Pablo Sandoval 's record - tying three home runs led the San Francisco Giants to an 8 - 3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the World Series"}, {"id": "374tnbha8bviqa3mnqz7woqk90aqy3", "turn_id": 4, "answer": "San Francisco Giants to an 8 - 3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the World Series"}, {"id": "374tnbha8bviqa3mnqz7woqk90aqy3", "turn_id": 6, "answer": "Tigers pitching ace Justin Verlander"}, {"id": "374tnbha8bviqa3mnqz7woqk90aqy3", "turn_id": 7, "answer": "ace Justin Verlander only managed to go four innings , allowing five runs on six hits .

The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder , arm , back , neck , or jaw . Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes . The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn . Other symptoms may include shortness of breath , nausea , feeling faint , a cold sweat , or feeling tired . About 30 % of people have atypical symptoms , with women more likely than men to present atypically . Among those over 75 years old , about 5 % have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms . An MI may cause heart failure , an irregular heartbeat , or cardiac arrest .    Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease . Risk factors include high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes , lack of exercise , obesity , high blood cholesterol , poor diet , and excessive alcohol intake , among others . The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque . MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms , which may be due to cocaine , significant emotional stress , and extreme cold , among others . A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis , including electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , blood tests , and coronary angiography .

You know people just like that , do n't you ? They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment , but as Henkel 's latest study has just found out , this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened , reported The Guardian . In her study , Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others . The next day the students ' memory of the tour was tested , and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them . \" When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves , it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences , \" Henkel explained . But there is also an exception : if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object , their memory actually improved , and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that were n't in the frame .

Since these new towns competed with the existing towns for business , there followed a low - intensity , long - lasting feeling of resentment , with failed attempts to limit the Jewish immigration . The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns , with only individual families setting up businesses in the rural regions ; this urban / rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors .
